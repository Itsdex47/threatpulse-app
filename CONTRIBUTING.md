## Coding Standards

### TypeScript
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define proper interfaces for data structures
- Avoid `any` type - use proper typing
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### React Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Use proper prop typing
- Implement error boundaries for critical features

### AI Integration
- Always include fallback mechanisms
- Implement proper error handling
- Add confidence scoring for AI outputs
- Test with edge cases and malformed data

### Security
- Never commit API keys or sensitive data
- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize data before AI processing
- Follow OWASP guidelines for web security

### Code Style

We use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting:

```bash
# Check linting
npm run lint

# Fix formatting
npm run lint:fix
```

**Key Rules**:
- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use single quotes for strings
- Add trailing commas in objects/arrays
- Use meaningful commit messages

## Commit Guidelines

We follow conventional commits for clear history:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

### Types
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Build process or auxiliary tool changes

### Examples
```bash
feat(ai): add DeepSeek fallback for threat analysis
fix(map): resolve marker clustering performance issue
docs(api): update threat analysis endpoint documentation
refactor(components): simplify ThreatCard component structure
```
